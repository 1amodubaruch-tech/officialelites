            <p class="last-updated">Global Effective Date: December 19, 2025</p>

            <section>
                <p>Welcome to <strong>Official Elites</strong>. We recognize that privacy is a fundamental right, especially in an era of digital connectivity and celebrity interaction. This document serves as a comprehensive disclosure of our data collection, storage, and processing practices.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">

            </section>

            <h2>1. Comprehensive Data Collection</h2>
            <p>We collect information that identifies, relates to, or could reasonably be linked with you. This is categorized as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Direct Identifiers:</strong> Real name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, and IP address.</li>
                <li><strong>Professional Information:</strong> For celebrity accounts, we collect professional history and verification credentials.</li>
                <li><strong>Biometric Information:</strong> If used for security verification, encrypted biometric signatures are processed but never stored in raw format.</li>
                <li><strong>Commercial Information:</strong> Records of membership cards purchased, donations made, and booking history.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Automated Technical Collection (Cookies)</h2>
            <p>Our futuristic interface utilizes advanced tracking technologies. This includes "Pixels" and "Cookies" to understand user behavior. We use these to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep your session active across multiple pages.</li>
                <li>Analyze which celebrity galleries are most visited to improve our content.</li>
                <li>Prevent unauthorized login attempts and protect account integrity.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>Official Elites uses the collected data for the following high-level purposes:</p>

            <h2>7. Security Infrastructure</h2>
            <p>The security of your data is our highest priority. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption for all data transmissions. Access to user data is restricted to authorized Official Elites personnel who have undergone background checks and signed non-disclosure agreements.</p>
